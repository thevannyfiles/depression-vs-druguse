# Depression vs Drug Use Analysis
This project explores the correlation between depression and drug use. The analysis is aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and potential relationships between these two variables using data science techniques.

## Introduction
Mental health and substance abuse are closely interrelated, and understanding the connection between depression and drug use is crucial for both clinical and public health interventions. This project aims to analyze datasets containing information on depression and drug use, applying various data analysis techniques to identify potential correlations.

### Objectives
* <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Prepare the data by handling missing values and outliers.
* <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Identify trends and relationships between depression and drug use.
* <b>Correlation Analysis:</b> Quantify the strength of the relationships using statistical methods.
* <b>Visualization:</b> Create meaningful visualizations to present findings.

## Features
* <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing data for analysis.
* <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Detailed analysis of the distribution of depression and drug use variables.
* <b>Correlation Analysis:</b> Calculation of correlation coefficients to measure the relationship between depression and drug use.
* <b>Data Visualization:</b> Visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to illustrate findings.

## Technologies
* <b>Programming Language:</b> Python
* <b>Data Analysis Libraries:</b> Pandas, NumPy
* <b>Visualization Libraries:</b> Matplotlib, Seaborn
* <b>Development Environment:</b> Jupyter Notebook

## Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges in this project was dealing with missing data and outliers, which could potentially skew the correlation results. Techniques such as imputation and data normalization were employed to mitigate these issues. Another challenge was identifying meaningful correlations amidst the noise, requiring careful statistical analysis.

## Future Improvements
* <b>Advanced Statistical Analysis:</b> Implement more sophisticated statistical models, such as regression analysis, to deepen the understanding of the relationship between depression and drug use.
* <b>Machine Learning Models:</b> Explore machine learning techniques to predict drug use based on depression scores and other relevant factors.
* <b>Interactive Dashboard:</b> Develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Dash or Tableau to make the analysis more accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
